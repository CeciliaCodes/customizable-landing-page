8.9.21:
This is a web dev project that will use all of my current skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, APIs, and more, if I happen to pick them up while working on this project.

The main goal is to have a customizable landing page, where the user can pick from a few preset layouts/colors. This choice will be stored locally so they can keep their customization every time they access the page. I'm including a nav bar for LinkedIn, Resume, Contact, and GitHub hyperlinks.

The layout/color selection will probably be a radio button panel on the right side of the page- don't have that sketched out at this moment.
